**KYC Automation System** 

🔍 Automating the KYC validation process with minimal manual intervention.

🚀 **Features**:
- **Web Form Submission**: Allows users to provide personal information, recent photos, and Aadhaar ID (front & back).
  
- **Face Match & Verification**: Compares the user's provided photo with the face on the Aadhaar card to ensure identity consistency.

- **Data Extraction & Validation**: Uses Tesseract for OCR to extract data from the Aadhaar card and validates it against the UIDAI database.

- **Seamless Onboarding**: Users are onboarded as customers only when there's a complete match between provided information and Aadhaar details.
