# KYC-Automation
We (a team of four) built a KYC Automation system to automate the KYC validation process. This project aims to eliminate the manual interventions required to process a KYC. The solution includes a Web form, where user can provide their information along with their recent photos and Aadhaar ID (front & back). The information provided by the user is validated against the ID card. This process requivalidatinge of the ID Card. They first matched the face on the Aadhaar card to the provided photo. All the other card information is extracted via tesseract and validated against the UIDAI database. Only when all the data is matched is the user onboarding as a customer. For a detailed description, read the attached ppt in the main branch.
